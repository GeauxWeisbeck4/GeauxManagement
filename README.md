# Geaux Management Sprint Website

Welcome to the Geaux Management Sprint Website for the Section 4 Mangement Sprint by Andrew Weisbeck! This is a website that will host my blog and a way for you to track my progress through my 10th Section 4 sprint, but first one of 2023. I am excited to be back in the Sprint Saddle and ready to create another website for my project to show what I have learned. 

I am using my GeauxAgile.js workflow to create this website which shows a backlog, in-progress, done and to-do tasks. It also has a blog and other things that will eventually turn into a full-blown website as my final product to show everything I have learned. It is to help you learn from me as much as it is for me to learn better. 

## How'd I make this?

Using the 11ty SSG! Also Stackblitz (my quick go to dev solution), VS Code, and Web Storm. Also JavaScript, HTML and CSS of course.
