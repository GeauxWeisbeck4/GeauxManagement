# Welcome to My Website for the Management Sprint by Section 4

I have already mentioned that this is already the 10th sprint that I will have participated in through Section 4. Does it seem like I love Section 4? That was a rhetorical question... but yes, I do! I am excited to be starting my first Section 4 sprint of 2023 and am putting a lot of time into making sure my website workflow is up to speed - and it is!

I used an [older 11ty starter project](https://github.com/mjgs/eleventy-agile-blog) that showed me how to create this workflow, and then I just enhanced it to how I like to use it for my Section 4 sprints. There is going to be a whole lot more refining going on with this thing throughout not only this sprint, but all the other sprints to come this year.

## Check out my work each day!

I Hope you enjoy tis project! It feels good be back working on a Section 4 sprint again. It's been a couple month since my last sprint. It's a sprint and not a marathon, so let's go get lots of work done quickly!

Thanks for reading and keep checking in for more informative and interesting posts!
