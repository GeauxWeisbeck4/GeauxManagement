# New Story Two

This is a new story template that can be used for this workflow. A story is an idea or "task" that will be used in a sprint. A story can contain many subtasks that are required to complete a feature, a project, or even a blog post. It is up to you to decide how to be most productive in your sprint.

While in progress, you will take notes here and mark off tasks as you complete them. You can see what it this looks like through each step by looking at New Story one and New Story Three.

## Goal

To make a new feature for my application.

## Tasks

- [x] This one thing
- [x] Start the timer
- [ ] Story reflection

## Notes

- I am a note.
- Me too dude.
  - I'm nested brah.
