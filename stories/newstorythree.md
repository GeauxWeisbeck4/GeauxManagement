# New Story Three

This is a new story template that can be used for this workflow. A story is an idea or "task" that will be used in a sprint. A story can contain many subtasks that are required to complete a feature, a project, or even a blog post. It is up to you to decide how to be most productive in your sprint.

Things are complete here. Check out my completed story and my reflections.

## Goal

To make a new feature for my application.

## Tasks

- [x] This one thing
- [x] Start the timer
- [x] Story reflection

## Notes

- I am a note.
- Me too dude.
  - I'm nested brah.

# Reflection

Next time I need to remember to put my pants on when I come to work. I got in a lot of trouble for that.
