# What's going on this week?

This page shows everything I have planned for the first week of my sprint and other things linked to it like sprint stories, posts, resources and more.

## Top 3 Objectives

1. [ ] Create Sprint Website and Plan out Design
2. [ ] Plan out management project
3. [ ] Network with fellow sprinters

## Week Preview

This week I want to get this website styled to look unique from my previous sprint websites and to fit the topic on what we are learning. I also want to know what my project will be before Thursday and start planning for that in the workbook. I also want to plan out my tasks for the week so I know what I need to get done.

Most importantly, I want to network with my fellow sprinters, as this is the most important part of these things.
